#1 To find the instance count of memories in the netlist
COMMAND: sizeof_collection [get_cells -hierarchical -of_objects "sram_sp*"]
OUTPUT: 12
COMMAND: sizeof_collection [get_cells -hierarchical -of_objects "rf_2p*"]
OUTPUT: 16

Hence, instance count of memories: 28

#2 To find list of memory configurations (i.e., type of memories) that have been instantiated
The memory configurations that have been instantiated are:
rf_2p_136d, rf_2p_256d, rf_2p_512p, sram_sp_16384d, sram_sp_32768d, sram_sp_512d.

#3 To find the count of flip-flops in the netlist
COMMAND: sizeof_collection [all_registers -flops]
OUTPUT: 61161

#4 To find the total number of instances in the netlist
COMMAND: sizeof_collection [get_cells -hierarchical]
OUTPUT: 308179

#5 To find list of all clocks in the netlist and their sources
COMMAND: sizeof_collection [get_clocks]
OUTPUT: 24

COMMAND: report_clocks > clocks.rpt
OUTPUT: clocks.rpt
